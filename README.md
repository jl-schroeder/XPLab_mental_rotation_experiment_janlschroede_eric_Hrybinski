In this experiment we changed the departure point template to instatiate five trials of a key press task with random pictures of the mental rotation task. 
The experiments shows in the final output the number of picture shown, the degree of rotation, if the objects are the same or different objects and if the participant took correct or incorrect choices.
The name for the picture gets randomly generated each trial.

P.S.: Does not work on GitHub directly, you have to download it for it to work.
